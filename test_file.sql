--To do
--Round ratings in both tables
---App store already rounded
--Get rid of $ sign in playstore prices
--Convert playstore prices to numeric (like appstore)

--Retreiving err with below. 
/*
SELECT rating
FROM app_store_apps
WHERE rating NOT LIKE '%.5'
	AND rating NOT LIKE '%.0';
*/

--Corrected. LIKE/NOT LIKE is a string comparison 
--Result: Every rating is rounded
/*
SELECT rating
FROM app_store_apps
WHERE CAST(rating AS TEXT) NOT LIKE '%.5'
	AND CAST(rating AS TEXT) NOT LIKE '%.0'
*/

--Playstore is not rounded
--7188 not rounded
/*
SELECT COUNT(rating)
FROM play_store_apps
WHERE CAST(rating AS TEXT) NOT LIKE '%.5'
	AND CAST(rating AS TEXT) NOT LIKE '%.0'
*/

--How do you change the format of the price table in play_store_apps? stuck
--Change $%.% to a number
